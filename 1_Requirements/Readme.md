## Introduction
I was introduced to the game Minesweeper by a math teacher when I was in high school as software that is included with Microsoft Windows. The game involves a square grid of cells, where the player attempts to click on every square except those that contain amine (bomb). If a beveled square is clicked, and does not contain a mine, it will show a number (or be blank if the number is 0). This number is the exact number of mines adjacent to that particular square. Using these numbers, the player must use deductive
logic (and in some cases probabilistic thinking) to hypothesize about where the mines exist by flagging them. Then by using this knowledge, the player continues until they accidently click a mine or they win the game.
Some versions of Minesweeper will set up the board by never placing a mine on the first square revealed.Minesweeper for versions of Windows protects the first square revealed; from Windows Vista onward, players may elect to replay a board, in which the game is played by revealing squares of the grid by clicking or otherwise indicating each square. If a square containing a mine is revealed, the player loses the game. If no mine is revealed, a digit is instead displayed in the square, indicating how many adjacent squares contain mines; if no mines are adjacent, the square becomes blank, and all adjacent squares will be recursively revealed. The player uses this information to deduce the contents of other squares and may either safely reveal each square or mark the square as containing a mine.

## Research
The game Minesweeper, and its variants, in contrast to many of the other games
studied for cognitive effects, is recognized to utilize direct logical thinking (Mackenzie,
1999). In 1995, Allan Struthers started to use the game Mine Hunter, a Minesweeper
variant, as an educational scaffolding technique to introduce proofs to students (Struthers,
1995). His success was later replicated by Patti Frazer Lock in 1999, to use the same
techniques in her classes to help teach mathematical proofs (Lock, 1999). Further,
Minesweeper may be a “content-free” method of teaching logical thinking, based upon the
idea that the content of the educational tool is thought itself. This might be similar to
Feuerstein’s Instrumental Enrichments which have shown some possibility of increasing
intelligence (Blagg, 1991).
## Cost and Features
Versions of Minesweeper are frequently bundled with operating systems and GUIs, including Minesweeper for IBM's OS/2, Minesweeper in Windows, KMines in KDE (Unix-like OSes), GNOME Mines in GNOME and MineHunt in Palm OS. Many clones can be found on the Internet.
Variants of the basic game generally have differently shaped minefields, in either two or three dimensions, and may have more than one mine per cell. For example, X11-based XBomb adds triangular and hexagonal grids, and Professional Minesweeper for Windows includes these and others. There are also variants for more than one player, in which the players compete against each other.
A logic puzzle variant of minesweeper, suitable for playing on paper, starts with some squares already revealed. The player cannot reveal any more squares, but must instead mark the remaining mines correctly. Unlike the usual form of minesweeper, these puzzles usually have a unique solution. These puzzles appeared under the name "tentaizu" , Japanese for a star map, in Southwest Airlines' magazine Spirit in 2008–2009.
